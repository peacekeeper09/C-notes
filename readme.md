Dated, 10 june am starting to learn c++ specifically for data strcutures and some nda projects.


You can refer to this repo for learning c++ too or just revising.



This is what a basic example or you can say a hello world code looks like in c++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << 0;
    std::cout << 99 <<endl;

    cout << 190 <<endl;
}


just remember that this is my personal note repo so you may or may not find comfortable while reading this
